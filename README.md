# wtk

Welcome the What The Kube (WTK), a monthly podcast hosted by @mrbobbytables and @jeefy 

This repo is meant to be a rallying point for episode artifacts, notes, and any pre-or-post questions or comments! After each episode we'll collect any links, articles, or projects we mention and collate them into a summary. Additionally, any code or tangible outcomes from episodes will also be stored here for archiving and perma-linking.

To ask questions or generally interact with us, please use the [Discussions Tab](https://github.com/grizzlygeeks/wtk/discussions)
